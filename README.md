## Project History

**FarmSmart: ML-Driven Hydroponic Farming for Climate-Resilient Agriculture in Rwanda**

Agricultural productivity in Rwanda is constrained by unpredictable weather, declining soil fertility, and inefficient use of water and nutrients. **FarmSmart** proposes the integration of **hydroponic farming systems** with **machine learning (ML)** to increase yields, optimize resource usage, and promote sustainable practices.

Our system leverages sensor data and predictive algorithms to recommend real-time optimal growing conditions. Theoretical modeling shows potential for a **20â€“30% yield increase** and **40% reduction in water use** over traditional methods.

The project is targeting smallholder farmers in peri-urban areas and seeks future pilot partnerships with **Green City Kigali** and **RYAF**.

## Introduction and Motivation

Agriculture employs over **70% of Rwanda's population**, yet faces increasing threats from land degradation, climate change, and inefficient traditional practices. There is an urgent need for **scalable, tech-driven agricultural solutions**.

Hydroponics offers a **soil-free, water-efficient** alternative to traditional farming. FarmSmart leverages **AI and localized environmental data** to help farmers make intelligent, data-driven decisions that lead to:

- Higher crop yields  
- Reduced resource consumption  
- Greater climate resilience  
- Youth engagement in agri-tech

## Problem Statement

While **AI-powered hydroponics** have shown impressive global resultsâ€”with **up to 10x yield improvements** in studies like Shreenidhi et al. (2021) and FAO trials (2025)â€”they remain **inaccessible to smallholder farmers** due to high costs and technical complexity.

Most systems (e.g., **AgriLyst, CropX**) target large-scale operations, leaving behind farmers in Rwanda, where hydroponics remains **manual, expensive, and hard to scale**.

**FarmSmart** addresses this gap with an **AI-enhanced hydroponic platform**, tailored to Rwandaâ€™s context. By integrating **affordable IoT sensors** with ML models, FarmSmart enables **real-time, precision farming** for smallholdersâ€”improving yields, resource use, and climate resilience.

## Model Evaluation Strategy

- All models evaluated on the **same test set**
- Metrics used:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **F1 Score**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
- **Best-performing model** is saved to `saved_models/best_model.h5` or `.pkl`
- Fallback logic ensures predictions work regardless of model type
